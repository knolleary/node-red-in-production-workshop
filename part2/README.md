# Part 2: Getting Started with the IBM Cloud

**Goal:** *Create an IBM Cloud account and install the `ibmcloud` command-line tool*

## Introduction

This section of the workshops takes you through the steps needed to get a cloud
environment setup for your application.

## Steps

 - [1 - Create an IBM Cloud account](#21---create-an-ibm-cloud-account)
 - [2 - Install IBM Cloud CLI](#22---install-ibm-cloud-cli)
 - [3 - Login to the IBM Cloud](#23---login-to-the-ibm-cloud)

## 2.1 - Create an IBM Cloud account

Follow [this link](https://ibm.biz/Bd2nay)* and sign-up for an IBM Cloud account. It's
free, doesn't require a credit card and lets you play with the services available

The IBM Cloud provides a command-line tool for working with your resources,
services and apps in the cloud.

## 2.3 - Login to the IBM Cloud

With the `ibmcloud` cli command installed, you can login by running:

    ibmcloud login

You can then target which region of the IBM Cloud your application will be deployed
to. Run the following command select a region (`us-south` or `eu-gb` for example).

    ibmcloud target --cf



## Summary

In this section of the workshop you have created an IBM Cloud account
and installed the `ibmcloud` command-line tool.
